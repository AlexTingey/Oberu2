# Oberu2
Updated version of my Highschool project Oberu. 

I created the first version before I really knew anything about decent software development. Rather than using a priority queue to implement the card sorting feature I simply used an array of objects which I constantly sorted using Java's Collections.sort() method. After learning Python I decided I needed a probject to work on and re-doing my highschool project to demonstrate my progress thus far seemed like a good idea. For user experience this version is nearly identical to the original version.
